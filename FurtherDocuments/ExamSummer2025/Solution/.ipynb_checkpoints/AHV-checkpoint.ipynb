    "**Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "a) **all:** Define a Markov Model based on semi-annual time steps for the anticipated and deferred annuitisation of AHV\n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Only Life Insurance Mathematics:** How do you tranform the annual incidence years to seminannual, and how do you model annuities paid 12x a year in this context. Can this type of insuance be solved by means of tradiditional life insurance mathematics (ie using commutation formular) - if possible provide the respective formuli; otherwise proof why not\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **all:** Calculate the respective Reserves for a man aged 62. Which is the most valuable returement age (assuming that there is no premium to be paid)? Please anser this question assuming there is a reduction in mortality as opposed to a constant mortality rate. For all following tasks assume teh mortality model including a reduction in mortality\n",
    "\n",
    "d) **Only Life Insurance Mathematics:** In order to determine whether which age is the best deal for a retirement age, one needs to also consider the contributions paid. The aim of this task is to do this. We assume a person starts paying at age 20 a premium, such which fulfils teh equivalence principle assuming an ordinary retirement at age 65. (Note the premium needs to cover also the deferred widdows pensions and we assume that the man is already married at age 20). The Premium is unchanged for differing retirement ages in terms of size, but is paid until the chosen retirement age. Question d.1) what is this premium, Question d.2) which is the most favorable retirementent age (you can look at the mathematical reserves for the differnt stages at age 20)?\n",
    "\n",
    "e) **Selected Chapters only:** Calculate the corresponding expected cash flows given one knows at which age a person will retire. Please present them as a replicating profolio in terms of zero coupon bonds ($\\mathcal{Z}_n$)\n",
    "\n",
    "f) **Selected Chapters only:** Consider now a given ex ante distribution of retirement ages and calculate the expected reserves and cash flows assuming a man aged 62; cash flows also represented as zero coupon bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "g) **Selected Chapters only:** Assume the asset allocation by means of zero coupon bonds is as per d). Which retirement age poses the biggest ALM risk against this asset allocation. We assume that the ALM risk is the maximum absolute difference of the ALM mismatch as a present value if interest rates move either 1\\% up or 1\\% down\n",
    "\n",
    "h) **all:** Discuss your findings and explain which asset allocation you would choose and why\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that the prinicpal receiver of the annuity is a male and there are two cases to consider, namely that the man is single or married. In the second case we assume that the spouse is 3 years younger.\n",
    "- We assume that the yearly annuity  (for an ordinary retirement age of 65) is CHF 24'000 in both cases and that the deferred widdows pension is 80\\% of the annuity.\n",
    "- We choose a technical interest rate (flat yield curve) of 2\\% and assume that the market interest rate is 2\\% (also flat yield curve)\n",
    "- The reference annuity is either reduced (in case of an anticipated retirement) or increased in case of a deferred retirment. The detailled changes are per appendix. Please note that the deferred widows pension is not changed if the (main) annuity is called earlier or later.\n",
    "- Note that the maximal anticipated annuity is at age $65-2=63$ and maxium deferral is up to age $65+5=70$. In the text the corresponding increases and decreases are given for each indiviual month (eg retirening at 63 years and 4 months. To keep the complexity of the model down we *assume* that refirement can take place all 6 months, ie at ages 63y0m, 63y6m, ... ,65y0m, 65y6m, ... , 69y6m, 70y0m. \n",
    "- For the distribution of the retirement age please use the following table. Note that you need to transform this abolute table into transition probabilities. Please explain how you do this.\n",
